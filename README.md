Boorusphere was supposed to be a simple booru viewer, but due to lack of interest, especially in flutter, it was shut down on July 19, 2024. It remains here for history's sake, although it serves no inherent purpose.

# Building from Source

- Install Flutter SDK, visit [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/) for more information.

- Fetch latest source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nullxception/boorusphere.git
cd boorusphere
```

- Sync dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

- Run code generator

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

- Generate translation

```bash
dart run slang
```

- Run the app with your favorite IDE/PDE. or from shell:

```bash
flutter run
```

### Protip:

- Run [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) after editing some areas that needs a code generator such as entities and routing.
- Run [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) after editing translation files (\*.i18n.json).
- [build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) and [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) has some features that will be helpful during development such as auto-rebuild and translation analysis, so it's highly recommended to check the documentations and familiarize yourself with it.

# Translation

### Translating untranslated strings

- Run slang analyzer to check for missing translations

```bash
dart run slang analyze --outdir=i18n
```

- Open [i18n/\_missing_translations.json](i18n/_missing_translations.json) and then translate your language of choice.

- After editing the file, you can apply it to the actual json translation file by running:

```bash
dart run slang apply --outdir=i18n

dart run slang analyze --outdir=i18n # update analyzation result files
```

### Note

You can leave untranslated strings on [i18n/\_missing_translations.json](i18n/_missing_translations.json).<br/>
It's perfectly fine and recommended to leave it unchanged rather than adding it on the actual translation json but leaving it untranslated.

### Adding a new language

You can copy [i18n/strings_en.i18n.json](i18n/strings_en.i18n.json) to `i18n/strings_<language-code>.i18n.json`.<br/>
At this point, feel free to pull request your new language here and we'll take care of adapting to the app code.

Or if you want to build and test yourself, then:

- Run slang to generate the strings.g.dart

```bash
dart run slang
```

- Run slang analyzer to check for missing translations

```bash
dart run slang analyze --outdir=i18n
```

- Build and run the app as usual
